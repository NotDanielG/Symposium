Goal:
Researching a way to rotate objects. The method I found was using AffineTransform and to rotate
it by a certain number of degrees in radians. For example, I can rotate a square by 45 degrees.
Also making the basic screen, GUIapplication. Also make a new class with a "z-position" which
will determine the location of the object outside the standard 800x600 screen. Tomorrow's goal
is getting the new class to show up on the screen.
