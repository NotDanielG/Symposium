Task done:
Researching a way to rotate objects. The method I found was using AffineTransform and to rotate
it by a certain number of degrees in radians. For example, I can rotate a square by 45 degrees.
Also making the basic screen, GUIapplication. Also make a new class with a "z-position" which
will determine the location of the object outside the standard 800x600 screen. Tomorrow's goal
is getting the new class to show up on the screen.

Task done:
From Nockles, he gave me a method on how to make the side scroll work. Was helpful but the
g.drawImage() is a bit confusing. I have to look into the method and how changing the numbers
affect the image and the location of the image. Made a bunch of new classes like Platforms, or
EnemyAttack. Platforms are what you can stand on, so the collision should be that if the bottom
of the character is inside the platform with a positive velocity(moving downwards). EnemyAttack
would kind of like the feces in the previous game except with animation. Could add new stuff
so that the attacks' speed change based on surroundings.

Task done:
Research on other types of side scrollers. Decided on what to focus on first, which is all of
the smaller classes, like Enemy or Platform. Getting the different areas to load will probably
take a lot of time to debug. I can debug the minor classes easier. Tomorrow's task should be
finding a suitable sprite sheet. I got something in mind and I need to find how to utilize the
sprite sheet.

Task done:
Found a way to use a sprite sheet using the subImage method that returns a BufferedImage of a
portion. Problem is that I don't use BufferedImage, I use Image. I tried using BufferedImage
version of drawImage but it didn't show anything. After around an hour of researching and 
playing around, I figured out that BufferedImage is a subclass of Image, so you can 
cast it and be able to use it as an Image.
